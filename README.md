# CSE 6140 - Fall 2014 Project

#### What? - [Project Description](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bdilkina/CSE6140-2014fa/ProjectTSP.htm)
-      Solve an intractable problem that is of practical importance
-      Implement an exact branch-and-bound algorithm for TSP
-      Implement heuristic algorithms for TSP (without approximation guarantees)
-      Implement approximate algorithms for TSP, that run in reasonable time and provide high-quality solutions
-      Develop your ability to conduct empirical analysis of algorithm performance on datasets, and to understand the trade-offs between accuracy, speed, etc., across different algorithms
-      Work in group with other students
